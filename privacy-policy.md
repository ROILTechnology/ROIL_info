We, at ROIL, respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. 

We believe that you have a right to know our practices regarding the data we may collect and use about you when you use our service. 

Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and regarding how we treat it.

In summary, when using the service, we may collect some personal data, all in order to provide you with the services and to show ads.  We believe in your right to use our service anonymously.  Consequently, we do not require personally identifiable information in order for you to create an account—although it may be required in order for you to use some service features.  If you do provide such information (e.g., email address) in your account setup, we encrypt this information when stored at rest.  In order to further ensure your privacy, traffic between your device and our service is encrypted via HTTPS.

We may use third party services to run the service; they have access to some of your personal data under a confidentiality obligation. If you play an embedded frame, then such iframe may be used to collect information from you as well.

We use industry standard practices to ensure that your data is kept secure, and we allow you to exercise your personal data rights granted under the GDPR even if you live outside the EU.

As a US Company, we are Privacy Shield compliant. You may exercise your legal rights under this framework; meaning you have the right to review all data relating to you, amend it if it is inaccurate, request that we stop processing it, request that we delete it, and seek remedies for any breach.

Also, we never sell your data or use it for direct marketing purposes.

And now for the full legal text

## About this Privacy Policy

This privacy policy was set up to let you know what personal data is collected. Personal data is defined in the GDPR, which is the EU Directive for data protection. While we are not based in the EU, we decided to grant all our users these protections. Also, we’ve done our best to adhere to the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, and therefore we do not sell your data; and we give you rights of a California resident, even if you do not reside in California.

## Who Are We?

Roil Technology, LLC, a Florida (USA) limited liability company, is the legal entity operating the service. It is located at 1300 N. Westshore Blvd., Ste. 220, Tampa FL 33607.

## Your Acknowledgment of this Policy

You are not legally required to provide us with any personal data. This means that if you provide us with data, you are doing so out of your own volition and consent; we cannot force you to provide any personal data, but without your personal data we cannot provide you with the services.

You have the right to withdraw from this consent at any time, and in such case request that we either cease processing your personal data, or that we delete whatever personal data is no longer required to retain under law.

## Which Personal Data Do We Collect About You?

We collect these types of personal data:

**Non-personally identifiable Data.** The first type is non-personally-identifiable data and statistical information. Non-personally identifiable data that is being gathered is comprised of technical information and behavioral information that does not pertain to a specific individual (“Non-Personal Data”).

**Technical Data that might be de-anonymized.** Technical information, such as the type and version of your device and its operating system, the type of browser, screen resolution, keyboard language, Wi-Fi connectivity and the type and name of your device and/or browser, your mobile operator service provider, etc is collected and retained according to this policy.

Additional information that may include your click-stream on the services, your activities on the services, including time spent on various screens and additional information of a similar nature.

While it is not specifically personally identifiable, it may be reverse-engineered to be identifiable and therefore is considered personal data.

**Personal Data.** The other type of data we collect is individually identifiable data. To put it simply, this data identifies an individual or is of a private and/or sensitive nature, such as your contact information, including: (i) Personal Data that is provided by you voluntarily, such as your username, email address and other data you filled when signing up; and (ii) Personal Data we learn from your use of the services; such as your favorite feeds. 

## How Do We Collect Personal Data?

Personal data is collected from your use of the services. We do not buy personal data from third parties and do not collect it in any other way.

## What Are the Purposes of the Collection and Processing of Data?

The purposes of collecting and processing the data are to provide you with the services, to allow you to interact with other users and to display advertisements.

Moreover, we may use the personal data to improve the services. 

## Your Personal Data Rights

### Right of Access and Rectification

You have the right to know what personal data we collect about you and to ensure that such data is accurate and relevant for the purposes for which we collected it. You can receive a copy of your personal data, and to rectify such personal data if it is not accurate, complete, or updated. However, we may first ask you to provide us with certain credentials to permit us to identify you before rectifying, deleting, or reviewing.

### Right to Delete Personal Data or Restrict Processing

#### Right to Withdraw Consent.

You have the right to withdraw your consent to the processing of your personal data. Exercising this right will not retroactively affect the lawfulness of processing your personal data based on your consent before its withdrawal. Please note that in most cases, withdrawal of your consent would most likely cause us to delete your personal data rather than cease processing.

You have the right to delete your personal data or restrict its processing by ourselves and third parties. We may postpone or deny your request if your personal data is in current use for the purposes for which it was collected or for other legitimate purposes such as compliance with legal obligations.

#### Right of Data Portability.

Where technically feasible, you have the right to ask to transfer your personal data in accordance with your right to data portability. In order to apply for this, please contact us at <notices@roil.com>, and we will process the request within a commercially reasonable time.

#### The Right to Lodge a Complaint

You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority regarding the processing of your personal data.

#### Your California Privacy Rights and Do Not Track Notices

We do not convey your personal data to third parties for direct marketing purposes. 

However, if we did, then the California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our customers who are California residents to request certain information regarding its disclosure of personal data to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.

To make such a request, please send an email to <notices@roil.com>, and we will let you know that none of your personal data was shared. We are only required to respond to one request per customer each calendar year.

#### We respond to "Do Not Track" signals.

If you do not wish your browser to allow us to use trackers, please use your browser’s “Do Not Track” option.

#### Exercising Your Rights

We acknowledge you have the right to access and change the Personal Data we collect and process. If you wish to access or to correct, amend, or delete Personal Data, please send us an email to: <notices@roil.com> and we will respond within a reasonable timeframe, but in any event no later than permitted by applicable law.

Additionally, please note that in order to ensure that you have as much control over your Personal Data and other information as possible, you may modify certain parts of your information by yourself in the service.

## Sharing Personal Data with Third Parties

We respect your privacy and will not disclose, share, rent, or sell your Personal Data to any third party, except as disclosed herein.  The sharing of your Personal Data is made upon your specific, explicit request.

In order to operate the service, we need to share your Personal Data with certain third parties. Our hosting provider is Amazon Web Services (“AWS”).  Your data is necessarily shared with AWS, as they provide our infrastructure.  Further, our service links you to third-party content hosts, sometimes through opening third-party content in an Internet browser tab, and sometimes in an embedded form, where the third-party content displays directly on our service.  In both cases, such usage may enable these third parties to collect Personal Data about you, which is outside of our control.

## Location of Your Data

The personal data collected from you, as detailed in this Privacy Policy, may be transferred to, and stored at, servers that may be located in countries outside of your jurisdiction and in a country that is not considered to offer an adequate level of protection under your local laws. 

It may also be processed by us and our suppliers, service providers or partners' staff operating outside your country.

We are committed to protecting your Personal Data and will take appropriate steps to ensure that your Personal Data is processed and stored securely and in accordance with applicable privacy laws, as detailed in this Privacy Policy. Such steps include putting in place data transfer agreements or ensuring our third-party service providers comply with our data transfer protection measures.

We will ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of your Personal Data by Transferring your personal data only to (i) countries approved by the European Commission as having adequate data protection laws; (ii) entities that executed standard contracts that have been approved by the European Commission and which provide an adequate level of high-quality protection, with the recipients of your Personal Data; and (iii) Transferring your Personal Data to organizations that are Privacy Shield Scheme certified, as approved by the European Commission.

By submitting your personal data through the service, you acknowledge, and agree, in jurisdiction where such consent is required, to such transfer, storing and/or processing of personal data.

## Minors / Children

The service is intended for users who are either adults, or children over our Minimum Age who have obtained permission (as described in our [Terms of Service]({% link terms.md %})) from their legal guardian.  For residents of the European Union, the Minimum Age is sixteen (16) years; otherwise it is thirteen (13) years.

Therefore, we do not intend and do not knowingly collect directly Personal Data from children under the Minimum Age and do not wish to do so. 

We reserve the right to request proof of age at any stage so that we can verify that minors under the Minimum Age are not using the service. 

If we learn that we collected Personal Data from minors under the Minimum Age (or other children who used the service without permission of their guardian) we will delete that data as quickly as possible. 

If you have reasons to suspect that we collected Personal Data from a minor under the Minimum Age (or lacking permission of their guardian), please notify us at <notices@roil.com>, and we will promptly delete that personal data.

## Third-Party Service Providers and Third-Party Software

While using the services we may be using third-party service providers, who may collect, store and/or process your personal data, as detailed in this Privacy Policy.

Note that we collect, hold and/or manage your Personal Data through our authorized third parties who are vendors of certain products or services (such as hosting cloud services) (including, as applicable, their affiliates) solely and limited to providing us with such requested services, and not for any other purposes.

## Security

We take appropriate measures to maintain the security and integrity of our service and prevent unauthorized access to it or use thereof through generally accepted industry standard technologies and internal procedures.

Please note, however, that there are inherent risks in transmission of information over the Internet or other methods of electronic storage and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access or use will never occur.

We will comply with applicable law in the event of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your Personal Data and will inform you of such breach if required by applicable law.

To the extent that we implemented the required security measures under applicable law, we shall not be responsible or liable for unauthorized access, hacking, or other security intrusions or failure to store or the theft, deletion, corruption, destruction, damage, or loss of any data or information included in the personal data.

## Data Retention

We will retain the Personal Data for as long as we believe that it is accurate and can be relied upon. Personal Data that is no longer required for the purpose for which it was initially collected will be deleted unless we have a valid justification to retain it that is permitted under applicable law, such as to resolve disputes or comply with our legal obligations.

## Complaints and Arbitration.

If you feel or believe that your personal data rights were harmed in any way or form, contact us at <notices@roil.com> using [this form](/word_templates/ROIL_other_notification_form.docx).

 and lodge a complaint. Such complaints shall include how and why you believe your personal data rights were harmed, and the required evidence. We will respond to most complaints within 14 days, and shall offer the required remedies.  If you make a request or complaint relative to your account on the service, you may be required to demonstrate that you are, in fact, the owner of the account, either by (a) responding, within the service, to a notification (i.e., demonstrating your ability to log-in), or (b) answering an email sent to an email address designated for the user account.  If you fail to set an account email address, and forget your password, we may be unable to take action, due to your inability to demonstrate ownership of the account.

In accordance with the Privacy Shield Principles, we will resolve all complaints according to the Privacy Shield and applicable regulations. We also agree to resolve all complaints and deal with disputes with the local data protection authorities.

This section does not limit your right to lodge a complaint with your respective data protection authority or to enter into a binding arbitration with us according to the Privacy Shield.

In order to invoke binding arbitration, you are required to (1) raise the claimed violation directly with us and afford us an opportunity to resolve the issue within the timeframe; (2) make use of the independent recourse mechanism under the Privacy Shield Principles, which is at no cost to you; and (3) raise the issue through your Data Protection Authority to the Department of Commerce and afford the Department of Commerce an opportunity to use best efforts to resolve the issue within the timeframes set forth in the Letter from the International Trade Administration of the Department of Commerce, at no cost to you.

## Updates to the Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time; we will provide you with updates on any change, and such updates shall not have a retroactive effect.

## Privacy Shield

We comply with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data transferred from the European Union to the United States.
