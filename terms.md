These terms of service apply to your use of the Roil Mobile App for iOS, the Roil app for Android, and roil.com (collectively, "ROIL" or "the ROIL apps").

ROIL will pass through to you various items coming from outside data sources, such as RSS feeds.  ROIL makes no warranties whatsoever as to these items.  Without limiting the foregoing, ROIL specifically disclaims any warranties of the items' accuracy, age-appropriateness, offensiveness, or copyright status.  Because ROIL does not control the content delivered to it by feeds, ROIL must parse these inputs.  ROIL makes no warranty that this parsing will be correct.

If you register a famous name on ROIL, but do not legitimately speak for that famous person/entity, ROIL may terminate the account, or transfer control of it.

You are granted a license to use ROIL for the purpose of personal consumption/enjoyment of the individual items presented by ROIL.  You are not permitted to use your access to ROIL for malicious purposes, which include, but are not limited to, (a) attempting to penetrate any ROIL database in a manner different from usual api usage, or through strategies including, but not limited to SQL-injection, (b) attempting to penetrate or obtain privileges over any ROIL backend computer, or (c) bombarding ROIL's backend with superhuman frontend demands.

You may only access ROIL's backend computers using the ROIL apps (as opposed to any other program), and you may not use a program to automate the function of the ROIL apps.  You may not scrape data from the ROIL backend.  Although, generally, you may create multiple ROIL user accounts, you may not do so in a manner to conceal excessive backend request activity.  ROIL may deny access to its services in whole or in part (including the termination of user accounts), and may revise these Terms in the future.

ROIL also adheres to a [privacy policy]({% link privacy-policy.md %}), which is hereby incorporated by reference.
