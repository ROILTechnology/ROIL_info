(ROIL is a service coming soon.)

ROIL is a better way to enjoy content from across the Internet. Instead of
browsing from one website to another, ROIL lets you follow many feeds from
across the web: podcasts, YouTube channels, subreddits, websites/blogs, and
more. It then connects to all this content for you to browse in one place: your
fun ROIL scroll. ROIL uses a technology called “feeds” (such as RSS) to gather
the latest content from websites or specific content creators you want to view.

ROIL will also recommend items it thinks you will enjoy. The goal is to
introduce you to new and interesting content you might otherwise not know
about.

ROIL is quite simply a way to find what you want on the internet without having
to search in many different places. You no longer have to go find newly posted
content because ROIL connects you to it.

# FAQs

## What does ROIL cost?

ROIL is completely free.

## How do I register?

In order to register you will need to provide a username, which is unique, and
a password. If you would like the option to restore your account if you forgot
your password, you may provide us an email address.

## What is a feed?

Feeds are the basis for the ROIL service. They are content based files that are
distributed by third parties. They are mostly RSS files, which are text files
that provide information in a computer readable format. ROIL collects RSS feeds
from websites and other content creators, such as podcasts and YouTube
channels. These items then appear in your ROIL Scroll.

## I am a creator. How do I claim my feed?

You may claim a feed, which is a process where you notify us that you
own/control a feed, and then either (1) grant us additional permissions in
using the feed, or (2) instruct us to remove the feed from ROIL.  If you no
longer post content to a claimed feed, you can set the feed as "inactive."
This is particularly useful if you have switched the location where you host
content.  ROIL facilitates you transferring the followers of your old feed over
to your new feed.  Also, if you would prefer to centralize the comments on your
content at a location other than ROIL, you can disallow ROIL comments on your
feed.

After making a claim on a feed, you must verify ownership/control in one of two
ways: (1) by inserting a token we provide (random string) into the feed
temporarily, or (2) receiving an email at an email address designated in the
feed.

## How do I find feeds that interest me?

To find feeds that you want to receive:

*Search*

- Click on the Feeds > Search tab at the bottom of the page.
- In the Search box at the top, search for the creator by their name, channel,
  subreddit, or website.
- If ROIL does not find it, then it may not be in our database and the feed
  will need to be discovered


*Discover*
- Go to the website you want to follow. For example, if it is a YouTuber, go to
  the YouTuber’s channel page.
- Copy the link and paste it into the ROIL search box. Click “Discover”.
- ROIL will now attempt to find that feed and, if successful, it will appear
  under “Discovered Feeds.”

After finding the feed you want, click the + button and choose which of your
groups you would like to add it to. Content from that creator/website/feed will
now start arriving in your “Scroll” tab, or by browsing the group that contains
that feed.  You can also view just the contents of that feed by clicking on it.

## What is a Group?

You start, automatically, with a “Favorites” group, where you can add feeds
that you like, or save items to return to later.    You can create new groups,
which may be (a) completely private, (b) shared among users you invite, or (c)
completely public.  You can also save groups created by others (if they are
public, or you have been invited).

A group functions not only to collect content, but also to organize discussions
in ROIL’s comment section.

*Content*

- The items you receive in the Scroll tab are based on which groups you have
  saved, and what content they contain.  You can choose to browse the scroll
  page within the context of a single group, which means that you will see only
  content from that group.

*Comments*
- If you want to comment on an item, you do so in connection with a group,
  meaning that the same item may have multiple simultaneous discussions,
  associated with different groups.  ROIL provides a comments “Roundup” view,
  where you can see all of the comments for a given item, from any group (so long
  as the group sets those comments to be shown in Roundup).

## Group Roles

Users can have different authorizations over groups.  In your “Favorites”
group, you hold the special “HOME” role, which is above all other roles, and
cannot be changed.  When you create a group, you receive the “OWNER” role.  You
can collaborate to make your group better by inviting additional users. The
role authorizations are as follows (each role also includes all the powers of
lesser roles):

- Owners: Can invite owners, and invite/remove admins.  The last remaining
  owner is able to delete the group.  (Typically, the only reason to add
  another Owner is when the original Owner wishes to resign, and hand the group
  over to a new Owner.)
- Admins: Can edit group settings—name, description, etc.—can moderate
  comments, and can invite/remove Editors.
- Editors: Can add/remove saved items or feeds to the Group. Can invite/remove
  Followers (if the Group is private).
- Followers: Users who have saved the Group.

## How do I import and export feeds?

You can export your feed subscriptions, in a machine-readable format (an OPML
file). Similarly, you can import feed subscriptions from other sources such as
feed readers or your YouTube subscriptions.

## Where do I go for more answers?

ROIL’s staff maintains the subreddit
[r/RoilRegulars](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoilRegulars/).  Please join us and
other ROIL users to discuss ROIL, ask questions, recommend feeds, and
collaborate to curate groups.
