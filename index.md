(ROIL is a service coming soon.)

ROIL is a better way to enjoy content from across the Internet. Instead of browsing from one website to another, ROIL lets you follow many feeds from across the web: YouTube channels, podcasts, SubReddits, Twitter accounts, websites/blogs, etc.  It then gathers all this content for you to browse in one place: its fun ROIL scroll. ROIL uses a technology called "RSS feeds" to gather the latest content from websites or specific content creators you want to follow.

ROIL will also recommend items it thinks you will enjoy. The goal is to introduce you to new and interesting content you might otherwise not know about.

ROIL is quite simply a way to find what you want on the internet without having to search in many different places. You no longer have to go find newly posted content because ROIL delivers it to you.

# FAQs

## What is RSS?

RSS means “Real Simple Syndication”  and Roil uses it to deliver you the latest articles, videos, and podcasts from some of your favorite websites or content creators. Instead of manually browsing to different pages on the Internet for newly posted material, the content you are looking for comes to you. An RSS feed is just a text file that provides updated information in a computer readable format. Roil collects the RSS feeds from the websites or content creators you want to follow and then converts it into text, audio or video content and puts it into your Roil scroll.

## What does ROIL cost?

ROIL is completely free.

## How do I follow someone on ROIL?

1. Click on the Follow tab at the bottom of the page.
2. In the Search box at the top, search for the creator by their name, channel, or most effectively by entering the web URL where they post their content. ROIL should now find that feed and it will appear under “Discovered Feeds”.
3. Finally, click the “Follow” button. Content from that creator/website/feed will now start arriving in your “Scroll” page.

## I searched for a feed and ROIL didn’t find it. What do I do?

1. Go to the website you want to follow. For example, if it is a YouTuber, go to the YouTuber’s channel page.
2. Copy the link and paste it into the ROIL search box. Click “Discover”.
3. ROIL should now find that feed and it will appear under “Discovered Feeds”.
4. Click the “Follow” button. Content from that creator/website/feed will now start arriving in your “Browse” page.

## As a creator, how do I make my content available on ROIL?

Go to ROIL, click on the “Follow” tab, and paste the web URL for your page into the search box.  If your hosting environment supports RSS (which it likely does), ROIL should discover your page, and display its feed.  From that point on, any ROIL user will be able to follow you.

## Why are some ROIL items incomplete or unreliable?

ROIL uses the metaphor of a telescope as a reminder that the content we show is not under our control.  Instead, we receive summaries from other sources on the web.  The choice of what those summaries contain is up to these outside sources.  We strive to present the received information in as pleasing/useful a manner as possible, and we try not to recommend items that lack important details.  We are also working to improve web standards in the sharing of such summaries.

## Does Roil take a piece of the advertising revenue from creators?

Absolutely not! That is between you and the site where you post your content. ROIL is able to gather data from almost any website, so if you host your own content on a personal website, you keep all of the advertising revenue you generate and your content can still be shown on ROIL.

## Can I leave Roil without losing my list of feed subscriptions?

ROIL uses a technology called “RSS feeds” to gather its content. At any time, you can export the list of feeds you are subscribed to and easily upload them to any other RSS aggregator program.
