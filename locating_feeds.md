## Searching Known Feeds

* In the “Search” box, type the name, website name, or channel name. Spelling
  and spaces matter. 

* If the website/channel does not appear, you can **Discover** it for everyone!  

## Discovering New Feeds

It is easy! And what you discover makes ROIL better for everyone!

### Discover By URL (recommended)

URL example: `https://www.example.com/abcdefg`.  Or `http://...`

Most effective way to **Discover** a new feed is to copy the URL and paste it
directly into the search box.

* Go to the website. E.g., a YouTuber’s channel page (not a single video page). 
* Copy the URL and paste it into the ROIL search box. Click **Discover**. 
* The feed will now appear under **Discovered Feeds**. 
* Click **Follow**.

Depending on the URL target, a feed may not be readily found.  Patience and
trial-and-error may help.  Fortunately, any given feed only needs to be
discovered once to be available forever.

### Discover Without a URL

You can also **discover** certain feeds without a URL. 

* Specify the “Source”, e.g. YouTube, Twitter, Reddit, etc. 
* Type the user name, channel, ID, etc. 
* If the feed doesn’t appear, enter the URL instead (see above).
